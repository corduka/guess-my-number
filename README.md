# 🎯 Guess My Number Game

A simple number guessing game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**. The objective is to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 20. Your score decreases with each wrong attempt, and you can try to beat your previous high score!

## 🚀 Features

- Random number generation between 1 and 20
- Real-time feedback on your guess (Too high, Too low, or Correct)
- Dynamic score tracking
- High score functionality across rounds
- Responsive UI with visual feedback
- Reset button to play again

## 🧠 How to Play

1. A random number between 1 and 20 is generated when the game starts.
2. Enter your guess into the input box.
3. Click the **Check!** button to submit your guess.
4. Receive instant feedback:
   - 📈 "Too high!" if your guess is higher than the number.
   - 📉 "Too low!" if your guess is lower than the number.
   - 🎉 "Correct Number!" if your guess is correct.
5. Your score starts at 20 and decreases by 1 for every incorrect guess.
6. If your score is higher than the current high score, it will update automatically.
7. Click **Again!** to reset the game and try again.
